#### DOCS FOR UNIVERSAL ROBOTS HACKATON ####

This code was developed for the first UR Hackaton Barcelona 2018 - Packaging and Logistics.

It consists of several modules made to run on the RPi in order to communicate with two AGV robots via bluetooth and two UR3 robots using TCP/IP.

The project was developed in 20 days and presented in the Hispack Fair 2018 in Fira Barcelona, where our team qualified as Finisher and won the prize of the competition.

Thanks to UR for he whole experience.
